            <h4>My </h4>
            <p>
                I am a graduate from the university of Salford 2016 with a Masters of Physics. While studying I learned how to code for MatLab and in my free time helped run a java based modded Minecraft server witch helped me learn to read java error logs and help fine the issue and submit bug reports and learned some basics in lua.
                <br>
                As time went i have grown more interested in programming and the IT sector of work.
